      <h2>My GitHub Journey</h2>
      <p>
        My GitHub profile reflects my ongoing commitment to learning, building, and showing up consistently. I’ve made it a personal goal to challenge myself through regular contributions and continuous improvement. The projects I’ve shared like my movie review and the Mommy & Me web project that documents a shared journey into coding, represent more than just practice. They’re reflections of creativity, persistence, and personal milestones.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each one tells a story of what I was learning at the time and what I wanted to express through design and development. I genuinely enjoy using GitHub not just as a place to store code, but as a space where my progress unfolds and my growth is made visible.

        <p>Hey there! I’m a lifelong explorer of all things creative, currently charting my course through the world of coding, and loving the wild ride. What began as a “why not try this?” moment has turned into a full-blown passion for turning ideas into interactive, functional things.</p>
        <p>Before code stole my heart (and my sleep), I was busy with photography, graphic design, t-shirt making, painting, and tackling any DIY project brave enough to cross my path.</p>
        <p>I’m drawn to the puzzle-solving side of development, and I get way too excited when things finally “just work.” I’m here to create, collaborate, and keep growing, whether it’s through clean code, bold design, or whatever creative adventure comes next. Thanks for stopping by my little corner of the internet!</p>

      <p class="goals-story">
        As someone completely new to coding just a few months ago, Ive been amazed at how quickly I’ve grown both in skill and curiosity. What began as a casual interest has turned into a serious commitment to learning and building. I’m particularly motivated by the hands-on nature of development—solving problems, designing from the ground up, and understanding how things work under the hood. One of the most meaningful parts of this journey has been sharing it with my 7-year-old son, who’s been exploring coding through Scratch and HTML since he was five. Learning together has strengthened our bond and fueled my drive even more. Moving forward, Im eager to gain real-world experience through internships or collaborative projects where I can continue growing alongside others in a team setting.

          <p>Today’s been a total whirlwind. For some reason, I decided coding was the thing I needed in my life. You know what started it? I realized I had absolutely zero clue where the internet even comes from. Big ol’ cables running across the ocean floor? Like... what?! Who knew that was a thing?</p>
          <p>I didn’t understand half of what this tech lady was saying, but honestly, it was kinda fascinating. So here I am, still confused but oddly hooked. No clue what I’m doing, but I think I’ll be back for more tomorrow.</p>

          <p>I’m chugging along through these coding videos, and wow… I’m overwhelmed. It feels like my brain is full, and I still barely understand half of it. How do people memorize all this? I’m taking constant notes, trying to absorb every little thing, but it’s like learning English all over again, just in a whole new format made of brackets, semicolons, and mystery.</p>
          <p>And yet… I’m intrigued. I don’t know why this is so fascinating to me, but it is. Somehow, 8 hours just flew by, and I’m still sitting here, slightly frazzled, but not giving up. Let’s see what tomorrow brings.</p>

          <p>Day 3, and whew, starting to feel like I bit off more than I can chew. Today we dove into lists. At first, I was cruising - ordered lists, unordered lists? Got it. Feeling good.</p>
          <p>Then she hit me with nested lists. Lists inside of lists?! My brain checked out immediately. It felt like I was staring at spaghetti code and trying to untangle noodles.</p>
          <p>But… 3 hours later, something clicked. And honestly? That little "aha!" moment was worth the struggle. Another skill unlocked. Another level up.</p>

        <h3 id="Push It Real Good"><time datetime="2025-04-08">April 08, 2025</time> – Push It Real Good</h3>
          <p>Here we are—Day 4—and I think I’ll keep this going for a full week, just for funsies. I’m really starting to get the hang of this. Coding has officially taken over most of my time (and my brain). Today I finally felt confident with the basics: headings like h1,h2,h3, paragraph tags, divs, and even article. It’s all clicking!</p>
          <p>The real win? I successfully created and pushed a new repo to GitHub! That felt like unlocking a new achievement badge. All in all, today was a great day. I’m still learning, still slightly overwhelmed, but I can feel myself leveling up. And that feels amazing.</p>

          <p>Today, I took a break from the structured lessons and followed my curiosity instead. We haven’t officially covered CSS in class yet, but I couldn’t help myself, I started Googling CSS properties just to see what they do.</p>
          <p>My artsy brain is on fire with ideas. I keep thinking about how I can beautify things, how to make code not just functional, but visually awesome.</p>
          <p>It’s like unlocking a creative playground I didn’t even know existed. Even though I’m not sure what I’m doing yet, I’m exploring, experimenting, and letting my imagination run wild. And honestly? That’s half the fun.</p>

        <h3 id="Day 6: Ctrl + Curiosity"><time datetime="2025-04-10">April 10th, 2025</time> – Ctrl + Curiosity</h3>
          <p>Today I found myself just typing random things into Visual Studio Code, tweaking, guessing, and watching what happens. Sometimes it worked, sometimes it definitely did not, but either way, it was interesting.</p>
          <p>I’ve been Googling everything, “Why does this work?” “What does that actually do?”,and honestly, I’m loving the process.</p>
          <p>The best part? I finally got my project layout to look the way I actually imagined it. That small win felt huge, and I’m ridiculously proud of myself for sticking with it and figuring things out on my own.</p>

        <h3 id="Day 7: Form-ally Addicted"><time datetime="2025-04-11">April 11th, 2025</time> – Day 7: Form-ally Addicted</h3>
          <p>Woohoo!! I made it through my first week of coding, and wow.. what an adventure it’s been!</p>
          <p>They say if you do something for 3 days, it becomes a habit. Do it for 3 weeks? That’s a routine. So that’s my next goal: keep showing up and keep building.</p>
          <p>Today I wrapped up forms and tables. I even built my very first survey, worked with table elements, and passed my quiz! That sense of accomplishment? Chef’s kiss.</p>
          <p>The real magic, though, comes when things don’t work. When I hit a wall, Google some answers, and finally figure out a fix, whether it takes 20 minutes or 2 hours, it’s pure satisfaction when it finally clicks.</p>
          <p>I’m proud of how far I’ve come already, and I’m genuinely excited to see where this journey leads next.</p>

          <p>Woo! this week flew by! I’ve been deep in learning mode, focusing especially on accessibility and how screen readers interact with code. I even built a design-focused movie page and a multimedia player, how cool is that?</p>
          <p>Balancing life and learning hasn’t been easy. But even when I’m away from my computer, I want to be back coding. I’ve caught myself watching tutorial videos on my phone and even listening to a podcast about semantic HTML.</p>
          <p>Coding is officially consuming my brain in the best way. It’s overwhelming, yes, but it’s also incredibly exciting. And if this is just the beginning, I can’t wait to see where it takes me next.</p>

         <p>This week’s been a wild ride, but super productive! I found a great course on Udemy that’s been helping fill in some of the gaps from FreeCodeCamp. Right now, I’m working through file paths, boilerplates, and image elements.</p>
         <p>I spent some extra time researching how to size images properly and optimize them for functionality, not just looks. It’s all starting to make a lot more sense now.</p>
         <p>Oh, and I started a new project just for fun, it’s called GardenVerse. Still a work in progress, but I plan to build it up as I learn more. It’s been exciting to see how far I’ve come and how many creative ideas keep growing along the way.</p>

        <p>Lately, I’ve been focusing on smaller projects, just revisiting the skills I’ve already learned so I can really lock them in. It’s been a good rhythm: repeat, reinforce, remember.</p>
        <p>And I’m super proud of this one, I've officially memorized how to use the terminal with GitHub! I can now upload new projects and update existing ones like a pro. It might sound small, but it feels like a huge win. Each little thing I master builds my confidence, and honestly, I’m pretty proud of the dev I’m becoming.</p>

        <p>Spent the day coding with my 7-year-old, and honestly, some moments it felt like he was teaching me!</p>
        <p>One little win I’m super proud of: I got to explain why we don’t use inline HTML styling like b for bold text, and instead use CSS for cleaner, more semantic code. I actually remembered it clearly, despite my brain feeling like mush lately, so that felt awesome.</p>
        <p>I’ve just been soaking it all in, practicing, watching videos, and slowly reinforcing what I’ve learned. I know the tougher stuff is coming, and I want to be ready with solid foundations.</p>
        <p>Today I also spent more time working on ARIA labels and role attributes. Accessibility is starting to really click for me. It was a good, confidence boosting day.</p>
